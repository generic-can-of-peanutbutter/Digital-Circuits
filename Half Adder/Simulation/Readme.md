# Half Adder â€“ Proteus Project

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project demonstrates a **Half Adder** circuit designed and simulated in **Proteus** using basic logic gates.  
A Half Adder is a simple combinational circuit that adds two binary inputs (A and B) and produces two outputs:
- **SUM** â†’ using an XOR gate  
- **CARRY** â†’ using an AND gate  

---

## âš¡ Features
- Implemented using **basic logic gates**:
  - XOR gate (for SUM output)
  - AND gate (for CARRY output)
- Inputs applied through switches.
- Outputs observed using **logic probes** .
- Simulation files included for **Proteus**.  
- Exported schematic and PCB layout provided in **PDF format** for easy viewing.

## ðŸ§© Circuit Explanation
- Input bits **A** and **B** are applied to both the XOR and AND gates.  
- The **XOR output** gives the **SUM** bit, shown on a logic probe.  
- The **AND output** gives the **CARRY** bit, also shown on a logic probe.  
- Logic probes display the output state (logic 0 or 1) during simulation.
